title: Cathedral Cove

So I visited Cathedral Cove on the same day as Hot Water Beach, but the post was getting too long so I thought I'd just do another one.

Cathedral Cove is another of those 'oooh you must visit this perfect paradise beach' place. So I dutifully did. Along with about 400 other people. 400 people on a beach is fine if were are talking Perranporth or Polzeath; that amount is fairly manageable. Cathedral Cove is around the same size as Tregantle, not so manageable and really quite crowded.

The exciting thing with Cathedral Cove is that the rock is wonderfully soft and so has been scultped into some interesting shapes by the water. A naturally accuring archway in the cliff connects to the next beach, which is so tall it coins the term 'cathedral'.

It was a 30 min walk along the cliff to get to the beach, which rendered some amazing views. I found a small hidden path that took me to a cliff edge where I settled down with my book and a bottle of water. No cathedral arches, but at least a spot of my own to sit down and some pretty stunning views!
