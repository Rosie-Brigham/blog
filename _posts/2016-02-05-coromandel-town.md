## Next stop, Coromandel Town

Top tip - if you want to treat yourself to an amazing tour of Mission Bay, the wind in your hair and the salt in your face then skip the bus and get the ferry across to Coromandel. It's half the time (double the money) but definately worth it.

The one thing to note with the ferry is that they will try to sell you onward trips, like a $40 trip to a beach, or shuttle buses to a specific walk. Don't bother. The bus will drop you off outside the local tourist office. The staff are absolutely lovely and have a well produced map of the local walks, which are really good.

The town itself was a wonderful mix of holiday village with victorian notes meets a spagetti western, and there was a shop selling pasties as well. The crimping was off, so I went for a sausage roll, better safe than sorry!

Accomdation wise I would highly reccomend Tidewater Tourist Park. I had the whole place to myself pretty much, it was the perfect relaxing remedy after a hectic stuffy 5 nights in the city.
