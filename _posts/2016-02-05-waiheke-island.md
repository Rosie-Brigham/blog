## First day in New Zealand...

...and I really have very few images to show for it...

Having got a fairly good nights sleep - I asked someone at the hostel reception what I should do for the day. He told me a ferry to Waiheke Island left in 30 mins from the dock, and it's a good day. I quickly hurried down, got the ferry, thouroughly enjoyed the ferry, got to the island and then realised I had absolutely no idea what this island was, what I should do on it, why people go there and where my guidebook was.

Luckily, I saw a guy from my hostel get on a bus and followed him. I tried to make this subtle, but when the bus driver asked me where I wanted to go, I confessed I had no idea where I should go, and that I only got on because I was following the crowd. 

Luckily, lift man (I had had a brief conversation with him in the lift that morning you see) seemed to be ok with the fact that I had followed him, and we pottered around the island together for the rest of the day.

Though with strange and creepy beginnings, it was an immensly pleasant sort of day. We drank beer, pottered on a beach, saw his ex boyfriends mums shop and broke into a vineyard. The day was only marred by the fact that I lost him as soon as we got back to hte hostel and didn't see him after that (maybe he was less ok with it...). I also can't remember his name.
