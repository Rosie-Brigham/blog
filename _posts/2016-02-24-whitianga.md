Interestingly, it is pronounced 'fi-tianga', as in Maori a word start with 'Whi' forms a 'ffi' sound. Confusing to start with, but not after a while - and certainly not to bad when you start taking some UK pronounciations into account (Fowey, Southwark, Liskeard ect..).

Anyhoo, the image above was taken from the top of the mountain range that runs down the Coromandel Penninsular whilst on an incredibly pleasant journey from Coromandel Town to Whitianga. One of the few plus points about New Zealand having no public transport (a gripe I will certainly address in a later post) is that the few services there are are completely tailored to tourists, so often the drivers will tell you about the history of the place you are driving through, and stop for photos at good viewpoints.

I stayed two nights in Whitianga, at the [Turtle Cove Hostel](http://www.turtlecove.co.nz/) - which was made frankly excellent by having free wifi (a very rare thing, most hostels will give you 30 mins free and then charge several dollars per half hour after that, grrr...). Like Coromandel Town it was exceptionally small, though with a good bookshop and a vaugely acceptable beach to read my purchases on (a fairly trashy Ken Follet thiller about the search for a missing painting). 

My time there was fairly marred by my eyes deciding to start exuding yellow gunk and sticking together. I woke up and pretty much couldn't open my right eye, so figured I should probably pop to the pharmacist. Two hours, two pharmacy trips and one opthomologist apointment later I was armed with some eye drops, a bill and the knowledge that whilst I had conjunctivitis, I didn't have emmacular degeneration. Which is always nice.

This diversion did, however make me late for my bus to **Hot Water Beach**. It's a bizarre beach about 1 hour from Whitianga which has a hot water spring underneath it. The side effect of this is that at low tide you can dig a pool which will fill up with warm water. It's essentially a DIY hot tub beach. Alas, as I was busy having my eye poked at, I got there as the tide was coming in and so no hot water pools for me. Just some gentle hilarity watching others deseperately dig pools and sit in them in denial trying to persuade themselves that it's warm as the tide comes creeping towards them. Did I take any photos of this? No, that would be far too sensible.

It was, however, a very pretty beach.
