Not many people like Auckland outside of Auckland, and it's fairly easy to see why. In a country renowned for it's countryside, Auckland is a fairly standard city. Most backpackers stay one night here and move on - as I was planning to, but something made me stay.

There is an interesting balance in the city, which has a huge immigrant Asian population (roughly 20%?). This diversity makes an interesting backdrop for  learning about the history of this comparitively new country, which had fairly fractious beginings.

This is further added to by the fact that Auckland is really just one big volcano crater which may explode at any moment. There are lots of computers monitoring the situation, but if it popped, well... New Zealand is very far from everywhere... This island in the picture above is the product of the last explosion - witnessed by the Maori about 800 years ago and seen as far as India, where records tell of an orange light to the far south.

These sculptures sort of show why Auckland is quite interesting once you start scratching away at the polished veneer. To the left is a sculpture celebrating the Maroi presence of the land, and to the right, Queen Viccy.

The former is called 'Te Ahi Kaa Roa' and represents continued tribal occupation, possession and guardianship of lands, waterways and taonga by the Ngati Whatua ki Tamaki tribe. They were the owners of the land (Auckland or Tamaki Makau Rau in Maori) for several centuries. The city of Auckland was established when Governor Hobson was invited to share the land, and he was gifted 16,000 acres in 1840. (Gifted or 'gifited', that's the question)

The four elements are all represented in the scultpure, each denoting a very powerful connection with the Ngati Whatua and the land. The fire burning on top references the burning of the heath, fires are a symbol of connection and belonging to a home land. The water that runs around and over the rock represents life and the sea surrounding Auckland and the rock itself is carved from basalt; the local stone. Basalt is integral to the Ngati Whatua culture as it is physically what the society is grounded upon. It represented the Earth Mother (Papatuanuku) who is enduring and immovable. Above all the sculpture represents Ngati Whatua as Tangata Whenua - People of the Land.

Compare that to the Queen Viccy sculpture found up the hill. Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Empress of India, this short, frumpy woman sat ceremoniously over a seriously ambitious group of colonialists. She sits pride of place Albert Park, named of course after Prince Albert. The statue is bronze and was erected about in 1897. Upon the queen's death the empire set aside a pot of money for monuments to be built for Vix around the entire empire. 150 alone were erected in India (if my memory serves me well, it's 5 years since that lecture). Through momuments like this her body was used to mythicise a The Glorius Victorian Emmpire. A strong prosperous enterprise that dominated the world and brought wealth to Britain and any could claim new land and make it their own.

Quite contradictory to the one down the road....
