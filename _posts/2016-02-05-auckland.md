Not many people like Auckland outside of Auckland, and it's fairly easy to see why. In a country renowned for it's countryside, Auckland is a fairly standard city. Most backpackers stay one night here and move on - as I was planning to, but something made me stay.

There is an interesting balance in the city, which has a huge immigrant Asian population (roughyl 20%?). This diversity makes an interesting backdrop for  learning about the history of this comparitively new country, which had very fractious beginings.

This is further added to by the fact that Auckland is really just one big volcano crater which may explode at any moment. There are lots of computers monitoring the situation, but if it popped, well... New Zealand is very far from everywhere... This island is the product of the last explosion - witnessed by the Maori about 800 years ago.
