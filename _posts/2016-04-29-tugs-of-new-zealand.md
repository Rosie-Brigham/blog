title: Tugs of New Zealand
---
This is a post pretty much exclusively for my Dad, as he loves tugs. 

I had intended to show him the vast array of different tugs in New Zealand, but then I realised the majority of my photos were all rather pants, so I've left quite a few out.

Anyway, congratulations on retirement Dad, here are some tugs you simply HAVE to come and see!

Not from New Zealand, but I thought I would include it as an all time favourite:

Me: Dad, how can you tell the difference bewteen Tregeagle and Pendinnick from so far away? (context, two of Foweys old tugs)

Dad: Simple. How do I tell the difference between all my daughters? The same logic applies...

Me: You do realise I'm not Nell right...

Dad: .....



Spotting tugs abroad has become quite a natural thing in the Brigham clan. But I guess he starts us all of pretty young - here he goes again...
