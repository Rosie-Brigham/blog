The day after trekking around Whitianga, Catherdal Cove and Hot Water Beach I went down to Wellington. This invovled a 5 O'clock start and 10 hours on two buses. But hey ho, it was an interesting journey. Everytime I looked out of the window the landscape had changed: Arable to mountainous, to lake to almost volcanic. I stopped in Lake Taupo for lunch.

When I stayed in a bizzaree place called The Cambdrige Hotel, whose tagling is "where people have been getting it on since 1893", I shit you not. In addition to that great little nugget, it also had a really good breakfast from Â£3.

I'm afraid there's not much to report on for Welly this time, I met up with the lovely Lettie Roach and we planned a quick trip to the South Island for some tramping. I will be returning on a more permantn basis, so don't worry, there will be far more Wellington reporting to come!
