## So this is my new blog.

I'm not sure if it will replace my old one ([found here](roosrambles.com)), but I've built it myself which gives me a lot more freedom about strucutre/content ect. The idea is that hopefully, between lounging on beaches, climbing mountains and reading trashy books on cliffs, I'll find some time to fancy pants it up. 

So, basically I'm planning to have three different categories of posts here, one will probably just be pictures of amazing things to make you all jealous. The second will be slightly more thoughtfull and planned posts about general observations/things I find interesting about NZ land. 

The third will be techy stuff - like how this blog was built, what code I find sexy, useful css hints and tricks etc etc. Tech muggles should feel free to ignore these - they will be mainly for my own amusement, and for any future employer to see how I do know some stuff about ze codes.

So here we go, let's see how much I keep this up!

I would include some images at this point but A) I still have yet to pick up an SD card reader to move them from my camera, and B) I havn't written the styles for images yet and it would look pants

Ta ta for now you lovely humans!
