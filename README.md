I have taken the base of this blog from a Jekyll theme produced by Hossain Mohd. Faysal. I have tinkered around with it a wee bit but the main functionality can be found on the notepad theme.

I have included a couple of easter eggs which can be found on my github acount - feel free to fork/clone share and enjoy!
